## 题目描述

```
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,
You need to output 2.

## 思路

## 关键点解析

## 代码

- 语言支持：Python，Java，JS

Python Code:

```python
ans=0
g.sort()
s.sort()
while g and s:
    if g[0]<=s[0]:
        ans+=1
        g.pop(0)
        s.pop(0)
    else:
        s.pop(0)
return ans
```

Java Code:

```java
      class Solution {
          // 先对饼干和小孩的胃口进行排序，然后小饼干满足胃口小的孩子
          public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
              int child = 0;
              int biscuits = 0;
              // 从小到大排序
              Arrays.sort(g);
              Arrays.sort(s);
              // 当饼干没了或者孩子已经全部分到饼干了，则遍历结束
             while (child < g.length && biscuits < s.length) {
                 if (g[child] <= s[biscuits]) {
                     child++; //饼干大于孩子胃口，分到饼干的孩子数量加一
                 }
                 biscuits++; //饼干只能用一次，所以遍历一次加一次
             }
             return child; // 分到饼干的孩子数量
          }
      }
```

Javascript Code:
**g:Children**
**s:装满不同大小的饼干盒**
```js
var findContentChildren = function(g,s){
    let res = 0;
    s = s.sort((a,b)=>a-b);
    g.sort((a,b)=>a-b).forEach(item=>{
        while(s.length){
            if(item<=s.shift()){
                res++;
                break;
            }
        }
    });
    return res;
};
```
