## 题目描述

```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## 思路

## 关键点解析

## 代码

- 语言支持：Python，Java，JS

Python Code:

```python
"""
从第二天开始到最后一天进行遍历，
如果后一天大于前一天，则ans加上这个差值，否则继续遍历。
时间复杂度O(n)=n
"""
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        ans=0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i]>prices[i-1]:
                ans+=prices[i]-prices[i-1]
        return ans
```

Java Code:

```java
/**
* 设今天的价格为p1、明天的价格为p2,则sum=p2-p1为赚的钱（为负则代表亏损）
* 遍历一次，如果sum为正,则买。连续上涨可以看成每天都买卖。
* 如果为负，表示下跌，则不买
* 遍历一次，所以时间复杂度为o（N）
*/
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices.length == 0) {
                return 0;
            }
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 1;i <= prices.length - 1;i++) {
                if (prices[i-1] < prices[i]) {
                    int price = prices[ i ] - prices[i-1];
                    sum = sum + price;
                }
            }

            return sum;

    }
}

```

Javascript Code:

```js
const maxProfit = function (prices) {
    var profit = 0, diff;
    var i;
    for (i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
        diff = prices[i+1] - prices[i];6-3  4-6
        if (diff > 0) { profit += diff; }
    }
    return profit;
}
```
